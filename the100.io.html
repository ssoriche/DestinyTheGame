		<p>The one with the purge.</p>

		<p>
		We breached the 100 member mark pretty quickly with a number of idle members. The switch to remove members who haven't signed up for
		an event in 30 days was turned on. Unfortunately the switch doesn't start counting 30 days from the day it's enable, but 30 days back.
		As such a number of members were removed. If you still want to be part of this group, please sign up again
		and make sure you are known to us in the IRC channel (sorry for the extra work). This switch has been disabled again.
		</p>

		<p>
		In the event that the group does fill up again, we can still invite people, just come into IRC and ask us for an invite.
		Community participating members will be invited ASAP.

		<p>I wanted to take a moment to talk about experience, raiding, and game postings.</p>

		<div style="margin: 0 auto 20px; padding: 12px 15px; border-bottom: 3px solid rgb(105, 157, 228);">
			<h4 style="font-weight: 400; margin: 0px; font-size: 15px; line-height: 20px;" class="hidden-xs">Experience</h4>
		</div>

		<p>First of all, an inexperienced player is NOT a bad player.  It just means that they aren't familiar with a certain piece of content.  We were all inexperienced at one point.</p>

		<p>Second, it is also NOT everyone else's job to make sure you get that experience.  It is YOUR job to read guides, watch videos, ask questions, etc.  The onus is on you.</p>

		<p>That said, a lot of us are sherpas and really like introducing content to newer players.</p>

			<h4 style="font-weight: 400; margin: 0px; font-size: 15px; line-height: 20px;" class="hidden-xs">Raiding</h4>
		</div>

		<p>This is the content everyone wants to get into.  And rightfully so, it's amazing in there!</p>

		<p>But before you sign up for a raid, make sure that you are "raid ready".  What does that mean?</p>

		<ol>
			<li>have the appropriate light level; with the loadout that you plan to run.</li>
			<li>use the correct subclass; I know you want to use your new subclass but if it's not leveled, don't...</li>
			<li>bring appropriate weapons for each encounter.</li>
			<li>research the fights!</li>
		</ol>

			<h4 style="font-weight: 400; margin: 0px; font-size: 15px; line-height: 20px;" class="hidden-xs">Game Postings</h4>
		</div>

		<p>These are all posted by you guys, and some of them will have requirements.  The requirements will vary from person to person, but I ask that we all respect those requirements when joining a game.</p>

		<p>There will be games that require experienced players.  This doesn't make that person an asshole.  Maybe they don't have time to teach mechanics and want to get through as fast as possible.</p>

		<p>There will also be games for those needing a sherpa.</p>

		<p>If you're inexperienced, don't sign up for the fast run.  Sign up for the sherpa run.</p>
